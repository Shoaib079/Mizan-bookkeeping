# BUGLOG

Bugs: symptom, root cause, fix, guarding test (see CURSOR_RULES.md §8).

## 2026-06-23 — Fresh `pip install -e ".[dev]"` failed on clean machine

**Symptom:** On a new venv, `pip install -e ".[dev]"` in `backend/` failed with setuptools error: *Multiple top-level packages discovered in a flat-layout: `app`, `data`, `alembic`*.

**Root cause:** Default setuptools package discovery treated `alembic/` (migrations) and `data/` (fixtures) as installable top-level packages alongside `app/`.

**Fix:** `backend/pyproject.toml` — `[tool.setuptools.packages.find] include = ["app*"]` so only the application package is installed.

**Guarding test:** Manual — empty venv + `pip install -e ".[dev]"` from `backend/` (documented in `DEV.md`).

## 2026-06-23 — FastAPI file-upload routes missing runtime dependency

**Symptom:** After editable install, importing the app or hitting upload endpoints failed with FastAPI’s `python-multipart` requirement error.

**Root cause:** `python-multipart` was not listed in `[project] dependencies` despite multipart/form upload routes (invoices, POS, bank statements, etc.).

**Fix:** `backend/pyproject.toml` — added `python-multipart>=0.0.9` to `dependencies`.

**Guarding test:** Manual — empty venv install then `uvicorn app.main:app` or pytest suite (upload tests exercise multipart).

# DECISIONS

Significant technical choices and rationale (see CURSOR_RULES.md §8). Product decisions live in Restaurant_Bookkeeping_App_Decisions.md.

## 2026-06-21 — Entity isolation via PostgreSQL RLS

**Choice:** Enforce multi-restaurant isolation at the **database** with PostgreSQL row-level security (`FORCE ROW LEVEL SECURITY`) on every entity-scoped table, plus application `entity_context()` setting `app.current_entity_id`.

**Why:** CURSOR_RULES §1 requires DB-level enforcement so no code path can leak across entities. RLS applies to ORM and raw SQL.

**Pattern for new tables:** inherit `EntityScopedMixin`, add table name to `app/db/rls.py` `RLS_TABLES`, include in Alembic migration.
